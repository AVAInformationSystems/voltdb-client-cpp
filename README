It includes binaries for libevent
If libevent is installed on your machine as a dynamic library, you can link to it
using the -levent and -levent_pthreads compiler flags instead of the static libs.

To use this, link in the voltdb static lib and the two relevant libevent static libs
into your binary. See the makefile.
