= VoltDB CPP Client

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following features were added:

Reconnect
    VoltDB client will reconnect to the node when the connection was dropped.

Transaction homing
    The implementation was based on Java version of the client. The client is
    able to 'guess' to which partition send a query when it deals with
    partitioned table.

Some performance tweaks
    Performance tweaks like passing arguments by reference instead of values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
    VoltDB CPP Client uses a subset of boost features that are shipped with
    the client source code. A makefile.boost is provided to use system boost
